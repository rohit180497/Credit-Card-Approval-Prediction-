## Introduction
This project aims to predict creditworthiness using personal data to help banks assess the likelihood of future defaults when issuing credit cards. By leveraging advanced analytics and predictive modeling, we strive to enhance risk management and streamline the credit approval process.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of:
- **Application Records**: 438,000 rows and 18 columns with applicant details such as income, education, employment status, and asset holdings.
- **Credit Records**: 1 million rows and 3 columns with payment history, credit utilization, and past defaults.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Steps taken:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
- Feature engineering and transformation.
- Train-test split for model training and evaluation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Key analyses include:
- Gender, marital status, education level, and occupation type distributions by target.
- Income variations across different demographics.
- Correlation analyses (e.g., between number of children and annual income).

## Modeling and Evaluation
Models used:
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge and Lasso Regularization
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest Classifier

Techniques applied:
- Data reduction and upsampling
- Feature importance analysis
- Decile mapping for model evaluation

## Conclusion and Future Scope
The project demonstrates the potential of predictive analytics in credit risk management. Future work can explore additional features, alternative modeling techniques, and real-time implementation for continuous improvement.
